# Chat Messenger - Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for my chatter messenger app. It provides the server-side functionality required for user authentication, message handling, and WebSocket communication. The chat messenger app is built using Node.js and Express.js for the server-side implementation. It utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing user information and messages. WebSocket is used to enable real-time communication between users.
